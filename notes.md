From Ingela:

> Hi,
> 
> Thank you for a good meeting tuesday. 
> 
> I have got three suggestions on potentially interesting mutations of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2
> to illustrate from Richard NordÃ©n and Gustaf Rydell who lecture on viruses on the MCB-course. Those are:
> 
>     * Mutations that affect glycosylation
>     * The mutation in the spike-protein identified in the minks in Denmark
>     * Mutations in the RGB-domain that are predicted to affect interactions with the receptor
> 
> 
> I guess the first one is not possible if carbohydrates are not visualised in the program, but maybe there are some useable structures for the other two.
> 
> Kind regards,
> Ingela
